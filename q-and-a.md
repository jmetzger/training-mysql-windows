# Questions and answers.

## 1. Do you recommend Aurora

```
In my current humble opinion Aurora is a double edged sword.
Aurora looks promising for scalablity, but a lot of stuff is modified
mysql-stuff and in my opinion has a lot of restrictions.

You should be aware, that moving to Aurora might be a tasks
and reverting back even more.
