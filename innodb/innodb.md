# InnoDB 

## Innodb buffer pool

  * How much data fits into memory 
  * Free buffers = pages of 16 Kbytes 
  * Free buffer * 16Kbytes = free innodb buffer pool in KByte  
```
pager grep -i 'free buffers'
show engine innodb status \G
Free buffers       7905
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

```
# Maximum the following buffer is used 
select @@innodb_buffer_pool_size;

# how much does server use 
show status like 'innodb%pages_free';

```

```
## my.ini oder 1M 
innodb-buffer-pool-size = 1G
# Server neu starten 
net stop MySQL80
net start MySQL 80
```

## 	innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit

```
When is fliushing done from innodb_log_buffer to log.
Default: 1 : After every commit 
-> best performance 2. -> once per second

# Good to use 2, if you are willing to loose 1 second of data on powerfail 
```

## innodb_flush_neighbors 

```
# on ssd disks set this to off, because there is no performance improvement 
innodb_flush_neighbors=0 

# Default = 1 

```

## skip-name-resolv.conf 

```
# work only with ip's - better for performance 
/etc/my.cnf 
skip-name-resolve
```
